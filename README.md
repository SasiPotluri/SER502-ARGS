Language Name: ARGS
Extension: .args

Introduction:
    Args is a programming language that has been intentionally created to be easily understandable and usable by people who have little or no experience in programming. 

Language Tools:
    To achieve a program output, the initial step involves reading the input file via a lexical analyzer, which converts the file's characters into tokens, stored in a token list. Following this, a parser verifies if the source code complies with the syntax rules and produces a parse tree. An interpreter processes the parse tree using syntax-based interpretation. The parser creates an intermediate code or parse tree file with a unique extension. These operations are designed in Prolog, utilizing list data structures.

System Used: 
    Windows and MacOS

Tools Used:
    Lexer - Python
    Parser - Python
    Interpreter - Python

Setup Instructions:
    - Install Python 3.x
    - Pull the latest code from GitHub
    - cd src
    - run shell.py file to access ARGS programming language.
    - To run the sample programs in data directory, copy path of the file in your local system
    - RUN("path_to_file")

                                <=:=(lessthanorequalto)
        -Logical Operators: &&(and), ||(or), ##(not)
